<b>Library Management System</b>
- Cataloging: An LMS allows libraries to catalog their collections, which means adding information about each item, such as the title, author, publisher, and subject. This information can then be used to search for items in the catalog.
- Circulation: An LMS allows libraries to track the circulation of their items, which means who has borrowed them and when they are due back. This information can be used to prevent items from being lost or stolen.
- Acquisitions: An LMS allows libraries to acquire new items for their collections. This includes ordering items, tracking their progress, and adding them to the catalog.
- Reporting: An LMS can generate reports on the usage of the library's collections. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions about collection development.
- Serials management: An LMS can manage the subscription of serials, such as magazines and newspapers. This includes tracking the status of subscriptions, renewing subscriptions, and claiming missing issues.
